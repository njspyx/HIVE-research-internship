### Gene Expression Predictive Signatures for Acute Myeloid Leukemia Using Machine Learning

My research as a Student Intern in the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment lab at the FDA. I used pathway analysis and supervised/unsupervised ML models to evaluate genes in the development of acute myeloid leukemia subclasses, as well as identify potential therapeutic agents. The project was completed during the summer of 2021 under the guidance of Dr. Konstantinos Karagiannis and Mr. Kamil Kural.
